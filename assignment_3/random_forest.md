## Assignmnet 3:  Random Forest

##### In this task you are suppose to implement 2 types of decision trees:  

1.  Usingonly Python.  
2.  Using random forest with a library such as sklearn.

##### The classification should be to predict recurrent cancer.
* Download  the  Breast  Cancer "[Breast Cancer Data](datasethttps://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer/breast-cancer.data)" 
* Predict the two classes:  Not-recurrent and recurrent
* Implement and test a decision tree from scratch using Python and stan-dard libraries.
* Implement and test random forest with a library such as sklearn.
* Choose the network architecture with care.â€¢Train and validate all algorithms.
* Make the necessary assumptions.
