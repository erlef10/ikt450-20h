# Convolutional Neural Networks

In this task you are suppose to implement a convolutional neural network using
a high level library, e.g. Keras.

- The classification should be about food.
- Download the [food image dataset](https://mmspg.epfl.ch/food-image-datasets) or 
[food 11](https://www.kaggle.com/vermaavi/food11/data)
- Predict the 11 classes: Bread, Dairy product, Dessert, Egg, Fried food,
Meat, Noodles/Pasta, Rice, Seafood, Soup, and Vegetable/Fruit
- Try some standard networks convolutional networks before more complex
ones.
- Hint: Start with a subset of the dataset
- Choose the network architecture with care.
- Train and validate all algorithms.
- Make the necessary assumptions.
